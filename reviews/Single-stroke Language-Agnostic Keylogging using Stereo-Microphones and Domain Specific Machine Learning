### Summary
* 基于Android OS结合stereo-microphones and gyroscopes，exceed 90% accuracy
* 结合两种方法记录声音：（1）the amplitude of audio signals at the two microphones （2）the other that uses the time delay between signals reaching
the two microphones。number of samples = （distance（T，M1）- distance（T，M2））*samples rate/speed of sound

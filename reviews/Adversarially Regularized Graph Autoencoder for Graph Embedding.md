##
### Summary
* In practice unregularized embedding approaches often learn a degenerate identity mapping where the latent code space is free of any structure
and can easily result in poor representation in dealing with real-world sparse and noisy graph data
* 
### Strengths / Novelties
* handle both topological and content information for graph data
*
### Weaknesses / Notes
